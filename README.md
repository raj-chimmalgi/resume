# resume
A simple Vue.js / JSON / CSS / Google Fonts resumé generator

I wanted a resumé that would:
* be easy to update
* separate the data from the presentation
* give me total control over every aspect of the formatting (via CSS), so I could...
* find a balance between aesthetic appeal and function -- ie, packing as much useful information as I could into a single page while still being visually attractive and readable
